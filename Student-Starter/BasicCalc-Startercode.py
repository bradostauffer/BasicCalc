We are making a basic calculator
Our Calculator has the four elementary functions, addition, multiply, subtraction, and division
We will prompt three inputs from the user: two numbers and an operation
'''
# Print a menu prompting the user four options; one for each operand.
"""
insert your code here. List all four operations. 
"""

''' The variables we use to store the user's inputs '''
operation = 'xxx'
num1 = 'xxx'
num2 = 'xxx'

def add():
    ''' Add the integers the user inputs and return the value. '''

def multiply():
    ''' Multiply the integers the user inputs and return the value. '''


def division():
    ''' Subtract the integers the user inputs and return the value. '''


def subtraction():
    ''' Divide the integers the user inputs and return the value. '''


'''
insert your code here.
We need to create four situations, one for each operand
After the operand is chosen, we want to print out the answer
Account for if the user inputs something other than the operand
If the user inputs an operand that is not one of our four designated operations, we need to tell them that. 
For example, if they want to add an exponet to a number, reply with "invalid input".
